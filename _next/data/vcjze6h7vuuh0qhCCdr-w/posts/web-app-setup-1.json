You may want to read this article while reading the code.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>When you Google how to create a react app, almost all the results you find will say, create a react app with ‘create-react-app’, and this is pretty much the same for angularjs and vuejs.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>I find this situation is hard to say. I don’t mean to say that these tools are bad, but on the contrary, create-react-app can save a lot of valuable time for someone who wants to quickly learn how to use Reactjs.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>But in the real world of development, I believe very few people are using create-react-app to build their company’s web applications. When you need to develop a complex project that integrates database, server and front-end, create-react-app feels like a toy.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>In addition to this reason, it is also important for developers to have a general understanding of how the application is built. Otherwise, according to this trend, it is not surprising that a front-end developer end up only know html-related stuff.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>Back to the point, let’s start thinking how to setup a web application project.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>Simply put, a web application requires a server and a client, we can design the server to be very simple, for example, all it does is to return the html page and js and css file when user make a request. In this case, the server is written in nodejs, and the front end code is using React. In order to build React app, we also need webpack as build tool.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>Let’s get started.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>1 . Create a folder and excute <code>npm init</code>, then create src folder.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>2 . Inside ‘src’ folder, create ‘app’ folder and ‘bin’ folder. The ‘app’ folder will conatin all the code of frontend and the server. ‘bin’ folder will contain all the code that relate to build process.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>Next, we are going to write our build tool and create a simple frontend entry file.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>3 . install package, here are the packages we need at this step:</p>\n<div class='preCodeBlock'></div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">&quot;@types/fs-extra&quot;: &quot;^9.0.6&quot;,\n&quot;@types/node&quot;: &quot;^10.14.6&quot;,\n&quot;@types/react&quot;: &quot;^17.0.0&quot;,\n&quot;@types/react-dom&quot;: &quot;^17.0.0&quot;,\n&quot;autoprefixer&quot;: &quot;^9.8.6&quot;,\n&quot;css-loader&quot;: &quot;^5.0.1&quot;,\n&quot;dotenv&quot;: &quot;^8.2.0&quot;,\n&quot;fs-extra&quot;: &quot;^9.1.0&quot;,\n&quot;postcss&quot;: &quot;^7.0.35&quot;,\n&quot;mini-css-extract-plugin&quot;: &quot;^0.8.0&quot;,\n&quot;postcss-color-function&quot;: &quot;^4.0.1&quot;,\n&quot;postcss-loader&quot;: &quot;^3.0.0&quot;,\n&quot;postcss-modules-values&quot;: &quot;^3.0.0&quot;,\n&quot;postcss-px-to-viewport&quot;: &quot;^0.0.3&quot;,\n&quot;react&quot;: &quot;17.0.1&quot;,\n&quot;react-dom&quot;: &quot;17.0.1&quot;,\n&quot;style-loader&quot;: &quot;^2.0.0&quot;,\n&quot;ts-loader&quot;: &quot;^8.0.15&quot;,\n&quot;ts-node&quot;: &quot;^6.2.0&quot;,\n&quot;typescript&quot;: &quot;~3.7.2&quot;,\n&quot;webpack&quot;: &quot;4.42.1&quot;,\n</code></pre>\n<p>A short description, I write down the version of these package because packages like ‘webpack’, ‘postcss-loader’ and ‘css-loader’ need be some specific version to be compatible with each other. If you upgrade webpack or postcss-loader to the latest version, you will always find one or the other problem when you build the project. This situation is really terrible, which is why I think it’s important to be able to create your own projects. Because you will know the details of each step are, and thus ensure the overall stability.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>We have webpack installed, but not webpack-cli, because we will use our own nodejs script to call webapck to compile and package the app. You may wonder why we do this, because in practice we may want to perform some additional tasks before the code is compiled, or we may want to make additional changes to the compilation results during the webpack compilation process, in short, webpack may be only part of the compilation and packaging process, but not the whole thing. (Later, when we use IPFS in a project, IPFS will be greatly involved in the process of code compilation.)</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>under ‘/src/bin’ folder, create this files:</p>\n<div class='preCodeBlock'></div>\n<pre><code>bin\n├── watch.ts\n└── utils\n    ├── paths.ts\n    ├── watch-webpack.js\n    ├── webpack-args.ts\n    └── webpack.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let’s talk about the role of each file.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>1 . <code>bin/watch.ts</code> is the entry file when we excute <code>npm run watch</code>, it takes the arguments we pass in from the command line, generates the webpack config with those arguments, and spawns a child-process to run <code>/bin/utils/watch-webpack.js</code>.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>2 . <code>bin/utils/paths.ts</code> export the path name of directory such as ‘build’, ‘public’.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>3 . <code>bin/utils/webpack-args.ts</code> define the entryPoints of frontend code and environment info :</p>\n<div class='preCodeBlock'></div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> WEBPACK_CONFIG = {\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;all&#x27;</span>: [{\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">env</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;development&#x27;</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">entryPoints</span>: { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">app</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;./src/app/start-client.ts&#x27;</span> },\n        },\n        {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">env</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;production&#x27;</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">entryPoints</span>: { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">app</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;./src/app/start-client.ts&#x27;</span> },\n    }],\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;dev&#x27;</span>: [{\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">env</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;development&#x27;</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">entryPoints</span>: { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">app</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;./src/app/start-client.ts&#x27;</span> },\n    }],\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;prod&#x27;</span>: [{\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">env</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;production&#x27;</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">entryPoints</span>: { <span class=\"hljs-attr\">app</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;./src/app/start-client.ts&#x27;</span> },\n    }],\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>the env and entryPoints data will be pass to webpack config builder.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>4 . <code>bin/utils/webpackpack.js</code> responsible for generating the webpack config object and exporting the functions that call webpack(configs).watch,</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>5 . <code>bin/utils/watch-webpack.js</code> call the watch function which exported from ‘bin/utils/webpackpack.js’.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>Now we need to focus on <code>bin/utils/webpackpack.js</code>. Because we are using typescript and react, we need to use <code>ts-node</code> in the module, since we are using css module, we also need use <code>MiniCssExtractPlugin</code>, <code>css-loader</code> and <code>postcss-loader</code>. Usually, we would set the localIdentName option in the css-loader so that the classname in the css file imported by the tsx module will be a unique string after compilation. However, for some third-party css frameworks, this will not work because the css code in those frameworks should not be modified and all the class name should be preserved.\nThe most obvious example of this is <b>Tailwindcss</b>. I will talk more about how to install Tailwindcss correctly later.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>Next, export the <code>watchWebpack</code> function, In this function, we manually call webapck.watch to compile and keep watch the file change.</p>\n<div class='m-5'></div>\n<p>This is what function looks lik:</p>\n<div class='preCodeBlock'></div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-typescript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">watchWebpack</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">specs</span>) </span>{\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">Promise</span>(<span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">resolve, reject</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> compiler = webpack(specs.map(getWebpackConfig));\n        compiler.hooks.watchRun.tap(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;WatchReportChangePlugin&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\">() =&gt;</span> {\n            logger.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">`webpack detected change...`</span>);\n        });\n        compiler.hooks.invalid.tap(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;WatchReportChangePlugin&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">fileName</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n            logger.log(<span class=\"hljs-string\">`webpack change detected to <span class=\"hljs-subst\">${fileName}</span>`</span>);\n        });\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> opts = {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">aggregateTimeout</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1000</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">poll</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">undefined</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">ignored</span>: [],\n        };\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> hasCompleted = <span class=\"hljs-literal\">false</span>;\n        compiler.watch(opts, <span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">err, stats</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n            <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (err) {\n                logger.error(<span class=\"hljs-string\">`web pack error: <span class=\"hljs-subst\">${err.message}</span> <span class=\"hljs-subst\">${err.stack}</span>`</span>);\n                <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (!hasCompleted) {\n                    reject(err);\n                    hasCompleted = <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span>;\n                }\n                <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span>;\n            }\n            <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (!hasCompleted) {\n                resolve();  \n                hasCompleted = <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span>;\n            }\n        });\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n","title":"WebApp setup from scratch","pic":"/images/web-app-setup-1/1.png","keyword":"React, Webpack, Nodejs","description":"Setup a web application from scratch without using create-react-app and webpack-cli.
